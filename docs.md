# AccuRecord - Centralized Patient History Management System

---

# Introduction

We are proud to present AccuRecord, a tool designed to transform how medical records are managed, accessed, and utilized. Let us show you how it addresses a pressing challenge in healthcare with innovation and impact.

# Relevance of Problem & Impact

In today’s healthcare landscape, medical records are often fragmented, inaccessible, or mismanaged. Studies show that 60% of patients encounter delays due to incomplete or unavailable medical histories, leading to misdiagnoses, redundant tests, and compromised care.

AccuRecord solves this. It’s a secure, centralized platform where:

- Patients can view their records anytime.
- Doctors can update medical histories in real time.
- Admins oversee and manage all operations effortlessly.

Our vision? To empower stakeholders with instant access to reliable medical data, improving healthcare outcomes for individuals and institutions alike.

# Preliminary Research

- As “paperless” is now the default operating mode for many healthcare systems globally, IT failures block access to records, prevent clinicians from ordering investigations, restrict service provision,4 and bring to a halt the everyday business of healthcare. Increasing digital transformation means such failures are no longer mere inconvenience but fundamentally affect our ability to deliver safe and effective care. They result in patient harm5 and increased costs.

- In order to achieve EHR’s full potential, it is critical to improve interoperability—that is, ‘the ability of health information systems to work together within and across organisation boundaries in order to advance effective delivery of healthcare for individuals and communities’.10 The lack of universal interoperability is often cited as one of the many significant shortcomings of EHRs currently in use, resulting in duplication in healthcare costs, increased clinician workload fatigue and poses a potential risk to patient safety.2 This is especially problematic for patient populations with chronic conditions, polypharmacy and multiple comorbidities who are reliant on effective patient information sharing via EHRs to facilitate their care.(https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)

# Proposed Methodology & Innovation

How it works:

- Role-Based Access: Patients, doctors, and admins have tailored views and permissions.
- Real-Time Updates: Doctors can modify records instantly, ensuring accuracy and timeliness.
- Secure Infrastructure: Data encryption protects sensitive information, adhering to privacy standards like HIPAA.

- Scalability: Designed to integrate seamlessly with hospital systems and scale for national healthcare databases.
  Future Potential: Enabling features like wearable health device integration and AI-based health analytics.

# Team Collaboration & Planning

Building AccuRecord was a team effort, leveraging our diverse skill sets:

- Front-End Development: Designed a user-friendly interface for seamless navigation.

- Back-End Engineering: Created a robust database system for secure and efficient data handling.

AccuRecord isn’t just a tool; it’s a step toward revolutionizing healthcare. By providing secure, efficient, and accessible medical record management, we aim to bridge the gap between patients and providers while alleviating administrative burdens.

Imagine a future where no critical medical history is ever lost, delayed, or inaccessible. **That’s the impact of AccuRecord.**

- HTTP-only cookies
- Role-based middleware

#### Authentication Flow

1. User submits credentials
2. Server validates credentials
3. Server generates JWT tokens
4. Tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies
5. Client includes cookies in subsequent requests
